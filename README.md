# SurveyTaker script

This is a script to help test the functioning of an important online survey site, 
which runs by fillng out the survey with particular answers, and submitting it.

To the run the script, and help test the survey, you will need the following installed:

- chromedriver
- ruby + bundler
- chrome
- git

Clone this repository, then run bundle install.

After that, simply run 'rake'. Feel free to write a shellf script to run rake multiple times
so the site can be fully tested.
